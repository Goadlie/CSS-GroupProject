Our project is an exciting and interactive quiz that aims to educate the public on the dangers of AI-driven misinformation, commonly referred to as "fake
news". We have put in a lot of effort to create an engaging and dynamic platform that not only entertains but also raises awareness of the rampant spread
of falsified information in modern society. Our ultimate goal is to empower individuals with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to
navigate the ever-changing landscape of information confidently and effectively. By doing so, we hope to help people safeguard themselves and their
communities from the harmful effects of misinformation.
